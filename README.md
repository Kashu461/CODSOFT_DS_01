CODSOFT

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, 
machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

projects

TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION : This dataset is used to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON : The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION : The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. the Iris dataset is used to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON : Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such asnadvertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.The role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION : In credit card fraud detection , I develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.here I Trained a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine, also Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
